I specialize in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I earned my Ph.D in Computer Science from 
 the [Federal University *of* Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), a masterâ€™s degree in Applied Computing 
 from [University of Camaguey](https://www.reduc.edu.cu/), and my B.A. in Computer Science from [University of Oriente](https://www.uo.edu.cu/).



My [research](research) focuses on the areas of computer vision, machine learning, and human visual perception. 
I am interested in learning and building systems that can perceive the world like humans do. Other interests 
include the image semantic understanding, the understanding of neural networks, the representation of image features, 
 and the intersections between psychology and the image's semantic representation.  I have [teaching](teaching) experience in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am a certified instructor 
from the [Universidad de Oriente](https://www.uo.edu.cu/), [University of Las Tunas](http://www.ult.edu.cu/) 
and [Federal University *of* Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/).
