<!-- I specialize in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I earned my Ph.D in Computer Science from 
 the [Federal University *of* Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), a master’s degree in Applied Computing 
 from [University of Camaguey](https://www.reduc.edu.cu/), and my B.A. in Computer Science from [University of Oriente](https://www.uo.edu.cu/).



My [research](research) focuses on the areas of computer vision, machine learning, and human visual perception. 
I am interested in learning and building systems that can perceive the world like humans do. Other interests 
include the image semantic understanding, the understanding of neural networks, the representation of image features, 
 and the intersections between psychology and the image's semantic representation.  I have [teaching](teaching) experience in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I am a certified instructor 
from the [Universidad de Oriente](https://www.uo.edu.cu/), [University of Las Tunas](http://www.ult.edu.cu/) 
and [Federal University *of* Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/). -->


I am Omar Vidal Pino, a passionate AI Scientist and Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at [Biel Glasses](https://bielglasses.com/). With over a decade of experience in Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV), I specialize in designing and deploying cutting-edge AI solutions that enhance human capabilities and solve complex challenges.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on AI and Computer Vision from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the [University of Camagüey](https://www.reduc.edu.cu/), and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the [University of Oriente](https://www.uo.edu.cu/).

### Research Interests
My research is centered on:
- Image semantic understanding and feature representation.
- Object recognition, description, and semantic classification.
- Exploring intersections between deep learning, generative AI, and human perception.

I have a strong record of [publications](https://ovidalp.github.io/publications/) in leading AI conferences and journals. My contributions include innovative work on Prototype Theory for semantic object description;  and applications of AI in embedded systems and industrial automation.

### Professional Highlights
- Currently leading research on smart glasses for people with low vision at [Biel Glasses](https://bielglasses.com/).
- Developed state-of-the-art Edge-AI solutions for driver monitoring and industrial applications at [Maxtrack](https://www.maxtrack.com.br/).
- Recipient of the prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship (Europe) and other academic honors, including the FUNDEP Scholarship (Brazil) and CAPES Scholarship (Brazil).

### Skills
I am proficient in advanced tools and technologies, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, OpenCV, and C++/Python, alongside strong expertise in deep learning architectures like CNNs and LSTMs. I am also skilled in teaching and mentoring, with a commitment to fostering innovation in interdisciplinary teams.
