### Course Description
<div style="text-align:  justify">
The Language Design and Implementation course explores the major issues in both the design and 
implementation of modern and  of high-level programming languages. The course provides a basic introduction to 
the underlying theoretical models on which programming languages and their compilers are based (elementary data 
types, data structures and encapsulation, inheritance, declarations, procedure invocation, storage management, 
processing, distributed and network programming). The course emphasizes underlying theoretical concepts as well 
as a practical and meaningful course project.
