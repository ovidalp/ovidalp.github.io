An understanding of C++ helps to solidify knowledge of programming concepts and provides a strong foundation 
for learning other programming languages. This course takes students' programming skills to the next level,
the course examines common programming constructs as they are implemented in C++. Topics include the use of C++
for memory management file input/output (I/O) pointers references exceptions and object-oriented programming. 
Basic data structures such as linked lists stacks and queues are covered in terms of their usage and 
implementation using C++. Modules in the course are accompanied by a mini-game project to teach the associated
programming concepts as well as to hone problem-solving skills and good coding practices.
