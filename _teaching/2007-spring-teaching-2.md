### Course Description: 
<div style="text-align:  justify">
This is a classical course in analysis, providing a foundation for many other mathematical courses. 
The course exposes students to rigorous mathematical definitions of limits of sequences of numbers 
and functions, classical results about continuity and differentiability, series of numbers and functions,
and their proofs. A particular focus of the course is in providing students with practical expertise
working with rigorous definitions and creating proofs. The following topics will be covered: sequences,
continuity, differentiability, series of numbers, series of functions.
