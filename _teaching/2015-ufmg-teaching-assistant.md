### Course Description
<div style="text-align:  justify">
The course covers digital design topics such as digital logic, sequential building blocks, finite-state machines, 
FPGAs, timing and synchronization. The semester begins with lectures and problem sets, to introduce fundamental 
topics before students embark on lab assignments and ultimately, a digital design project. The students design 
and implement a final digital project of their choice, in areas such as games, music, digital filters, wireless 
communications, video, and graphics. The course relies on extensive use of Verilog for describing and implementing
digital logic designs on FPGA.

### Course Objectives:
<div style="text-align:  justify">
On completion students will have confidence in their abilities to conceive and carry out a complex digital systems
design project in a team of two or three people. More broadly, they will be ready to handle substantial, 
challenging design problems. In particular, students will be able to:
</div>

  * explain the elements of digital system abstractions such as digital logic, Boolean algebra, flip-flops, finite-state machines (FSMs), and microprogrammed systems.
  * design simple digital systems based on these digital abstractions,and the "digital paradigm" including discrete, sampled information.
  * use basic digital tools and devices such as digital oscilloscopes, PALs, PROMs and VHDL.
  * work in a design team that can propose, design, successfully implement, and report on a digital circuit design project.
  * communicate the purpose and results of a design project in written and oral presentations. -->

### Course Description
The course covers foundational digital design concepts, including:
- Digital logic, sequential building blocks, and finite-state machines (FSMs).
- Use of FPGAs for timing and synchronization.
- Extensive practice with Verilog to describe and implement digital designs.

Students progress from theoretical foundations to practical lab assignments, culminating in a team-based final project in areas such as:
- Games  
- Music  
- Digital filters  
- Wireless communications  
- Video and graphics  

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will:
- Understand key digital system abstractions, including Boolean algebra, FSMs, and microprogrammed systems.
- Design digital systems using these abstractions and implement them using FPGAs.
- Gain proficiency with tools like digital oscilloscopes and VHDL.
- Collaborate in teams to propose, design, and implement a digital circuit project.
- Communicate design goals and results effectively through presentations and written reports.
