<!-- ### Course Description: 
<div style="text-align:  justify">
An understanding of C++ helps to solidify knowledge of programming concepts and provides a strong foundation 
for learning other programming languages. This course takes students' programming skills to the next level,
the course examines common programming constructs as they are implemented in C++. Topics include the use of C++
for memory management file input/output (I/O) pointers references exceptions and object-oriented programming. 
Basic data structures such as linked lists stacks and queues are covered in terms of their usage and 
implementation using C++. Modules in the course are accompanied by a mini-game project to teach the associated
programming concepts as well as to hone problem-solving skills and good coding practices.

It introduces key concepts of object-oriented programming, memory management, and basic data structures while fostering problem-solving and coding best practices through hands-on projects. -->

### Course Description
An understanding of C++ helps solidify knowledge of programming concepts and provides a strong foundation for learning other programming languages. This course takes students' programming skills to the next level, examining common programming constructs as implemented in C++. Topics include:

- Memory management
- File input/output (I/O)
- Pointers and references
- Exceptions
- Object-oriented programming

Additionally, basic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues are covered in terms of usage and implementation using C++. Each module is accompanied by a mini-game project designed to teach the associated programming concepts and hone problem-solving skills and good coding practices.
