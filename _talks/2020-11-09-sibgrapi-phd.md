Semantic Description of Objects in Images Based on Prototype Theory

## Talk Details

**Date**:  November 9, 2020 <br />
**Oral Session**: Workshop of Theses and Dissertations (WTD) <br />
**Language**: English <br />
**Title**: Semantic Description of Objects in Images Based on Prototype Theory.<br />
**Advisor**  : [PhD. Mario F. M. Campos](https://dcc.ufmg.br/professor/mario-fernando-montenegro-campos/)  <br />
**Co-Advisor**: [PhD. Erickson Rangel do Nascimento](https://dcc.ufmg.br/professor/erickson-rangel-do-nascimento/)  <br />


<!-- **Abstract**:
<div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for semantic description of object features based on the prototypicality effects of the Prototype Theory. Our prototype-based description model encodes and stores the semantic meaning of an object, while describing its features using the semantic prototype computed by CNN-classifications models. Our method uses semantic prototypes to create discriminative descriptor signatures that describe an object highlighting its most distinctive features within the category. Our experiments show that: i) our descriptor preserves the semantic information used by the CNN-models in classification tasks; ii) our distance metric can be used as the object's typicality score; iii) our descriptor signatures are semantically interpretable and enables the simulation of the prototypical organization of objects within a category. </div>  -->
